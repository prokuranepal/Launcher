<p>CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and
two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and this
licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).</p>
<p>The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.</p>
<p>Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
their development.</p>

<p>1.8 ‘Complete Source’ means the set of all Source necessary to Make
a Product, in the preferred form for making modifications,
including necessary installation and interfacing information
both for the Product, and for any included Available Components.
If the format is proprietary, it must also be made available in
a format (if the proprietary tool can create it) which is
viewable with a tool available to potential licensees and
licensed under a licence approved by the Free Software
Foundation or the Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need
not include the Source of any Available Component, provided that
You include in the Complete Source sufficient information to
enable a recipient to Make or source and use the Available
Component to Make the Product.</p>

Covered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will
remain easily accessible for at least three years for anyone to
obtain a digital copy.</p>
<p>1.10 ‘Notice’ means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,
Source Location references, modification notices (subsection
3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered
Source.</p>
<p>1.11 ‘Licensee’ or ‘You’ means any person exercising rights under
this Licence.</p>
<p>1.12 ‘Licensor’ means a natural or legal person who creates or
modifies Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a
Licensor at the same time.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>4 Making and Conveying Products</p>
<p>You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either
provide each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure
that each recipient is notified of the Source Location of the Complete
Source. That Complete Source is Covered Source, and You must
accordingly satisfy Your obligations set out in subsection 3.3. If
specified in a Notice, the Product must visibly and securely display
the Source Location on it or its packaging or documentation in the
manner specified in that Notice.</p>
<p>5 Research and Development</p>
<p>You may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to
a legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance
work on Your behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which
prevent the entity from both using the Source or Products for its own
internal purposes and Conveying the Source or Products or any
modifications to them to any person other than You. Any modifications
made by the entity shall be deemed to be made by You pursuant to
subsection 3.2.</p>
<p>6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY</p>
<p>6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY – The Covered Source and any Products
are provided ‘as is’ and any express or implied warranties,
including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of
third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use
are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the
maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no
representation that any Source or Product does not or will not
infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other
proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and
performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not
the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part
of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights
granted under this Licence.</p>
<p>6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY – The Licensor shall, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for
direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
punitive or other damages of any character including, without
limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of
use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused
and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including
negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way
in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source
and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of
the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the
Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,
damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,
in relation to such use.</p>
<p>7 Patents</p>
<p>7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each
Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4) patent license to Make, have
Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only
to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are
necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered
Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.</p>
<p>7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent
licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable
then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall
terminate as of the date such process is initiated.</p>
<p>8 General</p>
<p>8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining
provisions shall remain effective.</p>
<p>8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and
abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is
known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where
the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use
shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind
of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or
its personnel.</p>
<p>8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence
which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New
versions will be published with a unique version number and a
variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has
specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source
without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source
as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that
variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be
treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may
also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific
version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You
may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same
variant identifier published by CERN.</p>
<p>8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail
to comply with any of its terms and conditions.</p>
<p>8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your
Licence from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has
terminated this Licence by giving You, while You remain in
breach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure
it within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance
in all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should
You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and
subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate
immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply
after any termination.</p>
<p>8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor
acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are
specifically excluded.</p>
